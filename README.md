Yeah, Powercord is dead now. Plugins were working on Replugged (new Powercord) but Discord did an update and broke them so right now they are going through a rewrite. Also means I would have to rewrite the plugin but for now, I would like to wait until it's no longer a dev build of the client. GooseMod I could port over but not sure if many people use that and I will be planning on porting this plugin to BetterDiscord since that's the platform I plan to switch to. Also, some people on BetterDiscord have been porting plugins and not giving credit so I would like to beat them to the punch and make it official from me. But that's my update for this and the rest of my plugins. Sorry for the bad news. For now, the plugins will stay archived but if someone would like to help port them to Replugged when they update or on the dev build or move it to GooseMod and help maintain it then just contact me on Discord (Jet#2471)
